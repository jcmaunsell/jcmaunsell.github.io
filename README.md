## About me

**I care about people.** At Palantir, I worked for three years in a fast-paced, imaginative environment that can be difficult to navigate, and I’ve taken every opportunity to mentor others and create spaces in which folks feel comfortable sharing what they don’t know – this is the only way to learn and work effectively. As global coordinator for transgender employees and New York coordinator for LGBTQ+ employees in general, I worked to ensure that community members feel safe, cared for, and free to share their identities. This line traces back to college, when I served as president of my dorm at MIT during a difficult period that ended with the dissolution of the community. I learned a difficult lesson: best intentions on all sides will not end happily without shared empathy. We cannot move forward as a society without compassion.

As for technical experience: I took graduate-level classes at MIT in systems engineering during my undergrad there; I worked in Go at a distributed storage blockchain startup (talk to me about Go, but please no blockchains); I worked on build infrastructure as a software engineering intern at Palantir and received a return offer; and I worked on an experimental actor-based language framework as part of the MIT Programming Languages Group my senior year. As a full-time engineer at Palantir, I’ve worked on an distributed computation environment for data scientists, and on infrastructure to support software deployment under constrained network conditions.

I've grown a lot since college – as an engineer, and as a person. Some passions have remained constant: in particular, I am fascinated with languages, both computer and human, and the representation thereof. I have dreams about compiler code. But other passions took time to surface: specifically, I have found that my focus on empathy lends itself well to the design of user workflows, something I shied away from as a young backend developer insistent on proving my “technical” aptitude.

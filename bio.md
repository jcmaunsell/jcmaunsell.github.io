# About me

I'm a backend engineer with specific expertise in code execution, compilers, and distributed systems.

At MIT, I focused my coursework on compiler design, operating system engineering, and distributed system engineering.
I worked on a C++ transpiler for an actor-based Scala framework as part of the MIT Programming Languages group.

At Palantir, I worked on the Java backend for Code Workbooks, a Python, SQL and R coding environment orchestrated via Apache Spark on top of Kubernetes. 
I worked on the product's Python and R runtimes and rearchitected the product's code execution graph.
I also had a lot of fun designing workflows to support users with a range of technical experience.

Later in my time at Palantir, I moved to the Production Infrastructure organization, where I worked in Go and Java on the deployment of Palantir services to air-gapped Kubernetes clusters.

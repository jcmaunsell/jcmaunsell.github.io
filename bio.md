# About me

I care about people.

At Palantir, I worked for three years in a fast-paced, imaginative environment, taking every opportunity to mentor others and create spaces in which folks feel comfortable sharing what they don’t know – this is the only way to learn and work effectively. As global coordinator for transgender employees and New York coordinator for LGBTQ+ employees in general, I worked to ensure that community members feel safe, cared for, and free to share their identities. This line traces back to college, when I served as president of my dorm at MIT, a close-knit community of people with many different backgrounds. 

As for technical experience: I took graduate-level classes at MIT in systems engineering during my undergrad there; I worked in Go at a distributed storage blockchain startup (talk to me about Go, but please no blockchains); I worked on build infrastructure as a software engineering intern at Palantir and received a return offer; and I worked on an experimental actor-based language framework as part of the MIT Programming Languages Group my senior year. As a full-time engineer at Palantir, I worked on a distributed computation environment for data scientists, and on infrastructure to support software deployment under constrained network conditions. For more, see my [resumé](resume.md).

I've grown a lot since college – as an engineer, and as a person. Some passions have remained constant: in particular, I am fascinated with languages, both computer and human, and the representation thereof. I have dreams about compiler code. But other passions took time to surface: specifically, I have found that my focus on empathy lends itself well to the design of user workflows.
